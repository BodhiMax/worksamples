# Because much of my work has been in applictions, there's not a lot in the traditional sense of a "web page" that I'm allowed to share.
# Also, though I don't suppose the code is all that unique or sensitive, I still have an obligation to my clients to preserve their
# rights to intellectual privacy. So I've gone ahead and obfuscated or modified code to adhere to the spirit of this respect.
